automat
=======
(object/abstraction/patch for Max (because the decide object sucks))

Automat is a binary decision maker with a highly adjustable personality based on fractal noise and other things.  It inputs a bang and outputs a 1 or 0.

Inside, four logic layers each output "yes" or "no" based on values from fractal noise and then affirm or negate each other's decisions by consensus.

Changing the behavior of one layer changes what kind of voice it has.  Three consistent layers and one eratic layer will do some interesting stuff, for example.

Use it to make richer content than decide or fractal noise alone.  Take it apart, recalibrate it, etc.
